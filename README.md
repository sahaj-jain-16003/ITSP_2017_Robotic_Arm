## Problem Statement
To create a Robotic gripper attached to a Robotic arm controlled by an android application through bluetooth connection.
</br>
## Introduction
The purpose of our project is to construct a robotic gripper controlled with the help and support of an arm.Robotic manipulators have a diverse range of applications including welding automation, robotically assisted surgery and in space and were originally designed and used to deal with radioactive and biohazardous materials. This Robotic arm and its gripper will be controlled using an android application.
</br>
## Major Components Involved:-
1. Servo Motors(x7)
2. Arduino UNO R3
3. HC-05 Bluetooth Module
4. Gears(x2)
5. Aluminium sheets,Plywood,Nuts,Bolts etc.
</br>
## Phase 1:9th-19th June 2017
1.Brainstormed ideas and decided a design and concept for the project.
2.Successful in the creation of the gripper and successfully tested itâ€™s workings and operations.
3.Procured most of the materials required for the arm and gripper.
4.Learned Arduino IDE(only the skills required for our project).
5.Started working on the robotic arm
